ETH Advanced Systems Lab

The goal is to develop a message passing middleware platform supporting persistent queues and a 
simple message format. The idea is to build a simpler version of systems such as Apache ActiveMQ, IBM 
MQSeries, or JBoss Messaging. The programming language to use is Java and the database underlying 
the system should be PostgreSQL.
